I used Jquery to create divs and text upon user clicks which are not hard coded into the game. 
setInterval was used to create a timer function - which poses an additional challenge of completing the game within the given time.
All possible winning combinations were factored and placed in an array, which has a for loop iterating through and game number is increased to check for each possible win per "mini-game."
A few for loops were needed to iterate over: wins, mini-games, game rounds, and divs.

A few unsolved problems are: I'd like to create an overall win combination for a large board using the win value of the mini boards. That would require re-factoring some code, alterations and more time. 
I'd also like to include css animation for the strikethrough function of a win.
