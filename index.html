    <p class="rules"><strong>ARE YOU READY?! I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY FOR THIS JELLY!</strong>
      Rules: You must play these mini tic-tac-toe games in Human English Reading Order: starting with the top left -- from left to right then down to the next row, left-most square. (<i>If you're reading this intro, you know how to read left to right, congrats!</i>) You can <strong>ONLY</strong> play one mini square game at a time and can only move on once the square has been won or tied. Best out of 9 mini-games wins! May the odds be ever in your favor!</p>
